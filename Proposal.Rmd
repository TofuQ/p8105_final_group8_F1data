**Tentative Project Title**: Statistical Analysis of Accident-Prone Factors in Formula 1 World Championship - Insights from Formula 1 Race Data

**Motivation**

Formula 1 is one of the most technologically advanced and data-driven sports in the world, yet it remains inherently dangerous due to the extreme speeds and physical limits involved. Understanding the factors that contribute to car accidents in Formula 1 is essential not only for improving driver safety but also for enhancing race strategy, track design, and vehicle engineering.

In this project, we would like to know how variables such as driver age, city and manufacturers are related to the occurrence of Formula 1 accidents. Understanding these relationships can help identify patterns—for example, whether younger or older drivers are more prone to accidents, whether certain tracks or cities have higher crash rates, or whether specific cars tend to be involved in more incidents, contributing to both improved race conditions and more informed data analysis practices.

**Intended final products**

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (Box plot, Bar graph, Scatter plot)

2. Interactive data visualization (Shiny App)

3. Statistical analysis (Hypothesis Test, Regression)

**Anticipated data source**

1. [Formula 1 Race Safety](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jtrotman/formula-1-race-events/data) data (complements) from Kaggle

2. [Formula 1 Race Events](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jtrotman/formula-1-race-data) data from Kaggle

**Planned Analyses/ Visualizations**

Intervention by season/era, circuit, street vs. permanent; histograms of SC/VSC counts, red flag frequency over time. Distribution of car accidents by driver age, city and manufacturers, etc; Correlation analysis between car accidents and these variables, or other potential causes/associations among those factors. Accident Heatmap. Histogram of accident (yearly, by person,etc.)


**Coding challenges**

  One challenge in our project is that the dataset spans many years, which results in inconsistent records and missing values. In addition, the data sources are broken into multiple detailed tables (e.g., race location, driver profiles, car team information, etc.), so we need to carefully identify, filter, and merge only the datasets that are relevant to our analysis. 
  
**Planned Timeline**

November 1-9: Preliminary exploration and proposal.

November 10-14: Cleaning and visualizing the correlations between each factor (driver age, race location, cars, etc) and incident rates/race results.

November 15-25: Analyse data Statistically. Conduct additional outcomes and/or interactive visualization. Complete the discussion part.

November 26-December 1: Exchange ideas for members’ work and improve the project. Make screencast.

December 7-11: Complete and finalize the website. Check the reproducibility and dissemination.
