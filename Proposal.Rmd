## Motivation

Formula 1 (F1) is one of the most technologically advanced and globally followed motorsports in the world. However, throughout much of its early history, it was also one of the most dangerous. Fatal accidents, particularly between the 1950s and 1970s, were tragically common due to minimal safety regulations, developing engineering standards, and the extreme risks associated with high-speed racing.

The goal of this project is to examine **fatal driver events in Formula 1 from 1950 to 2024** and evaluate how safety has evolved over time. We aim to understand:

* When and why fatal events occurred.

* How fatality counts have changed over the decades.

* Whether certain teams, countries, or time periods were disproportionately associated with fatalities.

* Whether there is statistical evidence of improved safety following major regulatory changes.

This project highlights the evolution of safety in Formula 1 and provides a historical perspective on the sport’s most critical improvements

## Related Work
Our project was inspired by:

* Historical F1 fatality archives such as OldRacingCars, StatsF1, and Wikipedia’s list of fatal accidents.

* Discussions in class about web scraping, data cleaning, and exploratory visualization.

* Prior analyses on motorsport safety published in journalistic outlets and blogs, many of which show descriptive trends but lack statistical evaluation.

* The FIA’s safety reports and the significant regulatory reforms implemented after the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger in 1994.

* These sources influenced our project questions, website structure, and statistical methods.


## Initial Questions

At the beginning of the project, we aimed to answer broad questions:

(1) How many fatal driver accidents have occurred in Formula 1 history?

(2) Which time periods had the highest fatality rates?

(3) Which constructors and countries were most associated with fatal events?

(4) Did major regulatory changes significantly reduce fatalities?

As the project evolved, additional questions emerged:

* Were certain circuits or race types more dangerous?

* Were younger or less experienced drivers more at risk?

* How did the distribution of fatalities shift geographically over time?

During the exploratory phase, we refined our focus toward three major analytical themes:

(1) Temporal trends (fatalities per decade)

(2) Constructors and nationalities associated with fatalities

(3) Inferential testing to determine whether safety significantly improved after 1994

These new questions guided our statistical analysis and website design.

## Data
#### Data Source
Fatal event data was collected from a consolidated dataset derived from publicly available motorsport records.

Each fatal event entry included:

* Driver name

* Date of accident

* Race event and year

* Country and circuit

* Race type

* Constructor (team)

* Cause of death or accident description

#### Scraping Method
The original dataset was assembled using a combination of:

* Web scraping from motorsport archives

* Manual verification of ambiguous entries

* Text extraction and parsing from HTML tables

* Regular expressions to standardize date formats and names

#### Cleaning Steps
Cleaning required substantial work due to inconsistent formats across sources:

* Dates were converted into numeric year and month fields.

* Constructor names were standardized (e.g., "Ferrari", "Scuderia Ferrari").

* Driver names were trimmed and normalized.

* Countries were consolidated where naming variations existed (e.g., “UK” vs “United Kingdom”).

* Missing values in nationality or constructor were imputed or labeled `Unknown`.

A final, cleaned dataset was produced and used for all subsequent analyses.
